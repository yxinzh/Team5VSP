L2876/55/BLACK MATTE,55,black,matte,AMER,2024-04-01,4908.0,1129.0,59359,LA,LACOSTE OPTICAL,L2876,5515001,BLACK MATTE,235.0,0.0,Optical,Lacoste,Premium,Lacoste_black_46057,100,31,50.0,20.0,-55.00%,-3.23%,0,63,22,81,35,63,Rectangle,Full Rim,Plastic,0,0,0,1152,"The frame is a matte black style launching in AMER in April 2024. Matte black is a perennial best-seller and a safe, high-demand colorway. However, the FSA Glasses Search Index is relatively low at 22, suggesting we are not in a peak FSA/HSA spending window (those typically spike in Q4/Q1 as people rush to use benefits before year-end or after new allocations). The Metal Frames Search Index at 35 is moderate. The April launch timing means this frame will capture some spring refresh demand but misses the strongest FSA-driven purchasing periods. The L2876/55 geometry suggests a mid-to-large rectangular frame, which is a mainstream silhouette with broad appeal. Given that matte black consistently over-indexes in actual sales relative to model predictions due to its universal appeal and retailer confidence in stocking it, I apply a modest upward adjustment of ~2%. The adjustment is tempered because the macro indicators (low FSA search, moderate metal frame interest) don't signal outsized demand tailwinds, and the launch timing is neutral rather than advantageous."

However, the FSA search index at 18 is relatively low, suggesting we are outside peak FSA spending season (typically Q4/Q1), which limits upside. The metal frames search index at 41 is moderate, and while the style code (L2876) suggests a metal or semi-metal construction, the matte black finish gives it broad commercial appeal. A May launch aligns with spring/summer refresh cycles, which historically see decent but not peak optical demand. The CatBoost model likely captures most of these seasonal patterns, but matte black frames in AMER consistently show slight under-prediction in quantitative models due to their role as a 'safe default' choice that benefits from walk-in/impulse purchasing behavior not fully captured in trend data. Applying a modest +3% upward adjustment to account for the durable popularity of matte black as a core SKU and slight model under-prediction tendency for staple colorways."

The FSA search index at 18 is relatively low, suggesting we're outside peak FSA spending season (typically Q4/Q1), which limits upside from insurance-driven purchases. However, the May launch aligns with spring/summer refresh cycles where matte black frames perform well as a versatile, fashion-forward choice. Metal frames search index at 41 is moderate, and while L2876 appears to be a metal or metal-hybrid style (suggested by the naming convention), this mid-range interest level doesn't warrant a strong directional move. The CatBoost model likely captures the core demand pattern well here, but matte black in AMER consistently shows slight under-prediction in quantitative models due to its broad demographic appeal and retail staff tendency to recommend it as a safe choice. Applying a modest +3% upward adjustment to account for the durable popularity of matte black finishes and the spring launch timing advantage, partially offset by the low FSA index."

However, the May launch aligns with spring/summer refresh buying, and matte black is a universally safe, high-demand colorway that consistently outperforms model expectations by a modest margin due to its broad demographic appeal. Metal frames search index at 41 is moderate; without knowing if this is a metal frame, the signal is neutral. The CatBoost model likely captures seasonal and color trends well, but matte black in AMER tends to have a slight qualitative floor effect—retailers order confidently knowing sell-through risk is low, which can push initial orders slightly above pure statistical forecasts.
