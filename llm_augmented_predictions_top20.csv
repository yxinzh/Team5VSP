The low FSA Glasses Index (22) suggests weak healthcare-driven purchasing momentum, which typically boosts frame demand. Metal Frames Index (35) is moderate, indicating the broader frame market is not experiencing exceptional growth. AMER region in Q2 (April launch) faces post-tax season budget constraints. Matte black, while versatile, lacks novelty to drive trend-based over-indexing. The combination of weak FSA signals, moderate metal frame interest, and the commodity nature of matte black suggests the mathematical model may have slightly over-estimated demand.
