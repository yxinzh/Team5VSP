Matte black is a perennial best-seller and a safe, high-demand colorway. However, the FSA Glasses Search Index is relatively low at 22, suggesting we are not in a peak FSA/HSA spending period (those typically spike in Q4/Q1 as people rush to use benefits). The April launch misses that tailwind. The Metal Frames Search Index at 35 is moderate, and while the style code (L2876) suggests a standard silhouette, there's no strong viral or trend signal to amplify demand. The CatBoost baseline of 1129 seems reasonable. I'm applying a modest +2% uplift (~23 units) because matte black consistently over-indexes in AMER due to its universal appeal and versatility, which purely mathematical models sometimes underweight when trend indices are middling. The combination of a safe colorway in the largest region provides slight upside that quantitative features may not fully capture, but the low FSA index and lack of strong macro tailwinds limit the adjustment."
